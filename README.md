# Hotel-Management-System
The main objective of this project is to create a database management system for a hotel. The hotel can have multiple chains, which can further have multiple hotels linked with it. Therefore, we need an organized management system, which can easily manage all the operations and data of the hotel chains and hotels respectively.
